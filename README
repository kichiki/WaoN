What's new?

     * Aug. 8, 2015: waon-0.11 released
     * Mar. 3, 2013: move the project from sourceforce to github.
     * Jan. 1, 2012: add "Demo" section.
     * Dec. 27, 2011: waon-0.10 released. (Release Note)
         waon: the quality of result is improved by cleaning up useless notes.
         gwaon: horizontal keyboard is added on the spectrum pane.
       
What is WaoN?

   WaoN is a Wave-to-Notes transcriber, that is, the inverse of
   'timidity' (and its descendants timidity++, and timidity with Gtk+).
   ("WaoN" also has a meaning of harmony of notes or chord in Japanese!)
   My original intention is to pick up voicing of harmony from sound of
   my favorite pianists. (I have no talent to do so, but computer will
   :-) But there is no functional application of this kind on Unix
   platform, as far as I know. So that I start writing WaoN by myself.

   Currently, WaoN contains three programs:
     * waon: transcriber (wav-to-mid converter)
     * pv: phase vocoder for time-streching and pitch-shifting
     * gwaon: GUI for waon and pv

   WaoN is released under the GNU General Public License.
   
Features

     * read wav file and write standard MIDI file format 0.
     * stdin/stdout can be used as input/output file.
     * no explicit limits of number of notes at a time or along the time.
     * patch file (wav) can be used.
     * pitch shift.
       
Platform

   I believe that WaoN is able to be built on any platforms.
   I am developing this project currently on Mac OS X (and,
   before that, on FreeBSD).

   Since version 0.11, Win32 binaries (built on MinGW) are ready.

Formats

   WaoN's native format as sound-input is WAV, and that as note-output is
   standard MIDI format 0. If you have SoX, you can use almost all sound
   format as input. In addition, if you have timidity or some midi player
   which could read standard MIDI file from stdin, you can play resultant
   midi file on time. See also Tips.

WaoN - a Wave-to-Notes transcriber, Version 0.11

Web: http://kichiki.github.com/WaoN/

WaoN is a Wave-to-Notes transcriber,
that is, a converter from sound file to midi file.

Usage: ./waon [option ...]

Options:
  -h --help	print this help.
  -v, --version	print version information.
OPTIONS FOR FILES
  -i --input	input wav file (default: stdin)
  -o --output	output mid file (default: 'output.mid')
	options -i and -o have argument '-' as stdin/stdout
  -p --patch	patch file (default: no patch)
FFT OPTIONS
  -n		sampling number from WAV in 1 step (default: 2048)
  -w --window	0 no window
		1 parzen window
		2 welch window
		3 hanning window (default)
		4 hamming window
		5 blackman window
		6 steeper 30-dB/octave rolloff window
READING WAV OPTIONS
  -s --shift	shift number from WAV in 1 step
		(default: 1/4 of the value in -n option)
PHASE-VOCODER OPTIONS
  -nophase	don't use phase diff to improve freq estimation.
		(default: use the correction)
NOTE SELECTION OPTIONS
  -c --cutoff	log10 of cut-off ratio to scale velocity of note
		(default: -5.0)
  -r --relative	log10 of cut-off ratio relative to the average.
		(default: no relative cutoff
		= absolute cutoff with the value in -c option)
  -k --peak	peak threshold for note-on, which ranges [0,127]
		(default: 128 = no peak-search = search only first on-event)
  -t --top	top note [midi #] (default: 103 = G7)
  -b --bottom	bottom note [midi #] (default: 28 = E1)
	Here middle C (261 Hz) = C4 = midi 60. Midi # ranges [0,127].
  -a --adjust	adjust-pitch param, which is suggested by WaoN after analysis.
		unit is half-note, that is, +1 is half-note up,
		and -0.5 is quater-note down. (default: 0)
DRUM-REMOVAL OPTIONS
  -psub-n	number of averaging bins in one side.
		that is, for n, (i-n,...,i,...,i+n) are averaged
		(default: 0)
  -psub-f	factor to the average, where the power is modified as
		p[i] = (sqrt(p[i]) - f * sqrt(ave[i]))^2
		(default: 0.0)
OCTAVE-REMOVAL OPTIONS
  -oct	factor to the octave removal, where the power is modified as
		p[i] = (sqrt(p[i]) - f * sqrt(oct[i]))^2
		(default: 0.0)

Tips

   I think that the default setting (2048 samples for FFT, no window,
   etc) is enough to judge how "WaoN" works.
   
   Here are some more tips.
   
   Ex.1) if you need more resolution in time, use -s (--shift) option as
          follows.
          $ ./waon -i waltz4DB.wav -o waltz4DB.mid -w 3 -n 4096 -s 2048
          
   Ex.2) you can use stdin and stdout, so that you can use timidity to
          play resultant midi file on time.
          $ cat dolphineD.wav | ./waon -i - -o - | timidity -id -
          
   Ex.3) if you want to analyse MP3,
          $ mpg123 -m -s reflectD.mp3 | sox -t raw -r 44100 -s -w - -t
          wav - | ./waon -i -

   You need FFTW library to compile WaoN. (Of course, you could use your
   favorite FFT routine easily by modifying WaoN's source a little bit.)
   
BUGS

    1. ...
       
TODO

    1. improve algorithms -- partly done by phase vocoder technique.
       current focus is on time-domain.
    2. give some examples and instructions.
