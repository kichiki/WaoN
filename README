What's new?

     * Jan 10, 1999 : start gWaoN page.
       
What is WaoN?

   WaoN is a Wave-to-Notes transcriber, that is, the inverse of '
   timidity' (and its descendants timidity++, and timidity with Gtk+).
   ("WaoN" also has a meaning of harmony of notes or chord in Japanese!)
   My original intention is to pick up voicing of harmony from sound of
   my favorite pianists. (I have no talent to do so, but computer will
   :-) But there is no functional application of this kind on Unix
   platform, as far as I know. So that I start writing WaoN by myself.
   WaoN is released under the GNU General Public License.
   
Features

     * read wav file and write standard MIDI file format 0.
     * stdin/stdout can be used as input/output file.
     * no explicit limits of number of notes at a time or along the time.
     * patch file (wav) can be used.
     * pitch shift.
       
Platform

   I believe that WaoN is generic, but developed on FreeBSD.
   
Formats

   WaoN's native format as sound-input is WAV, and that as note-output is
   standard MIDI format 0. If you have SoX, you can use almost all sound
   format as input. In addition, if you have timidity or some midi player
   which could read standard MIDI file from stdin, you can play resultant
   midi file on time. See also Tips.

  help
  
$ ./waon --help
WaoN - a Wave-to-Notes transcriber, version 0.1a
Copyright (C) 1998 Kengo ICHIKI

Usage: ./waon [option ...]
  -h --help     print this help.
  -v --version  print version info.
OPTIONS FOR FILES
  -i --input    input wav file (DEFAULT stdin)
  -o --output   output mid file (DEFAULT 'output.mid')
        options -i and -o have argument '-' as stdin/stdout
  -p --patch    patch file (DEFAULT no patch)
NOTE SELECTION OPTIONS
  -c --cutoff   log10 of cut-off ratio to scale velocity of note
                (DEFAULT -5.0)
  -r --relative log10 of cut-off ratio relative to the average.
                (DEFAULT no relative cutoff
                = absolute cutoff with the value in -c option)
  -k --peak     peak threshold for note-on, which ranges [0,127]
                (DEFAULT 128 = no peak-search = search only first on-event)
  -t --top      top note [midi #] (DEFAULT 103 = G8)
  -b --bottom   bottom note [midi #] (DEFAULT 28 = E2)
        Here middle C (261 Hz) = C3 = midi 60. Midi # ranges [0,127].
  -a --adjust   adjust-pitch param, which is suggested by WaoN after analysis.
                unit is half-note, that is, +1 is half-note up,
                and -0.5 is quater-note down. (DEFAULT 0)
READING WAV OPTIONS
  -n            sampling number from WAV in 1 step (DEFAULT 2048)
  -s --shift    shift number from WAV in 1 step
                (DEFAULT same in the value in -n option)
FFT OPTIONS
  -w --window   0 no window (DEFAULT)
                1 parzen window
                2 welch window
                3 hanning window
                4 hamming window
                5 blackman window
                6 steeper 30-dB/octave rolloff window

  analyse
  
$ ./waon -i duet-suite.wav -n 1024 -p piano1.wav -r 1
WaoN : Reading Wave file: Microsoft PCM format,
        1 channel, 11025 samp/sec, 11025 byte/sec, 1 block align,
        8 bits/samp, 9922500 data bytes.
WaoN : Reading Wave file: Microsoft PCM format,
        1 channel, 44100 samp/sec, 88200 byte/sec, 2 block align,
        16 bits/samp, 106848 data bytes.
WaoN : end of file.
WaoN : difference of pitch = -0.077538 ( + 0.000000 )
WaoN : # of notes = 26617

Tips

   I think that the default setting (2048 samples for FFT, no window,
   etc) is enough to judge how "WaoN" works.
   
   Here are some more tips.
   
   Ex.1) if you need more resolution in time, use -s (--shift) option as
          follows.
          $ ./waon -i waltz4DB.wav -o waltz4DB.mid -w 3 -n 4096 -s 2048
          
   Ex.2) you can use stdin and stdout, so that you can use timidity to
          play resultant midi file on time.
          $ cat dolphineD.wav | ./waon -i - -o - | timidity -id -
          
   Ex.3) if you want to analyse MP3,
          $ mpg123 -m -s reflectD.mp3 | sox -t raw -r 44100 -s -w - -t
          wav - | ./waon -i -
          
Download

  source
  
   WaoN version 0.1 (source waon-0.1.tar.gz) is now available.
   
  library
  
   You need FFTW library to compile WaoN. (Of course, you could use your
   favorite FFT routine easily by modifying WaoN's source a little bit.)
   
BUGS

    1. ...
       
TODO

    1. stereo
    2. improve algorithms
    3. give some examples and instructions here
    4. make GUI for WaoN in order to adjust parameters (with Gtk+)
