INSTALLATION NOTES
==================


1. all at once
==============

To compile all programs "waon", "pv", and "gwaon",

   1. take a look at "Makefile" and edit it if necessary.
   2. invoke "make", for example.
   3. you'll see "waon", "pv", and "gwaon". copy it wherever you want.

You need the following libraries:

    * Gtk+
    * FFTW
    * libsndfile for audio input
    * libao for audio output
    * libsamplerate for pitch-shift


2. waon
=======

To compile the program "waon",

   1. take a look at "Makefile.waon" and edit it if necessary.
   2. invoke "make -f Makefile.waon", for example.
   3. you'll see an excutable "waon". copy it wherever you want.

For "waon", you need FFTW library and libsndfile.
(If you have FFTW version2, add -DFFTW2 to CFLAGS.)


3. pv
=====

To compile the program "pv",

   1. take a look at "Makefile.pv" and edit it if necessary.
   2. invoke "make -f Makefile.pv", for example.
   3. you'll see an excutable "pv". copy it wherever you want.

For "pv", you need the following libraries:

    * FFTW
    * libsndfile for audio input and output
    * libao for audio output
    * libsamplerate for pitch-shift


4. gwaon
========

To compile the program "gwaon",

   1. take a look at "Makefile.gwaon" and edit it if necessary.
   2. invoke "make -f Makefile.gwaon", for example.
   3. you'll see an excutable "gwaon". copy it wherever you want.

For "gwaon", you need the following libraries:

    * Gtk+
    * FFTW
    * libsndfile for audio input
    * libao for audio output
    * libsamplerate for pitch-shift
